# CNVcaller protocol
## Introduction
The DNA sequence along all species chromosomes is constantly changing, and this process enables humans to evolve and adapt. We have long been aware of genetic variation at either size extreme - cytogenetically recognizable segments<sup>1</sup> and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)<sup>2</sup>. About 10 years ago, scientists began to recognize abundant variation of an intermediate size class known as structural variation<sup>3-5</sup>. Within this class, copy number variation (CNV), which involves unbalanced rearrangements that increase or decrease the DNA content, accounts for the largest component by far. We now typically define the size of CNVs as larger than 50 bp<sup>6</sup>, whereas smaller elements are known as insertions or deletions (indels). These structural variations encompass more polymorphic base pairs than SNPs by an order of magnitude.
